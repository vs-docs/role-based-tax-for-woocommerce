# Tax Calculation

## Configuring Tax Options

To start configuring taxes:

Go to: **WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Tax**. This tab is only visible if taxes are enabled.

The **Tax** tab displays several options that can be set to suit your needs â€” settings you choose are based on the tax jurisdiction under which your store is located.

Once you have configured all the tax in WooCommerce. go to **Role Based Tax** Settings page and set tax Calculation based on user roles.
